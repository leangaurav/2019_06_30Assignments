### Assignment_8Files

## 1)1. Write a program in python that stores alphabets from a to z in a text file
import string

with open('alphabets1.txt', 'w') as f:
    for i in range(97, 123):
	    print(chr(i),end = '', file = f)
		
with open('alphabets2.txt', 'w') as f2:
    print(string.ascii_lowercase,file = f2)	
	

## 2. Write a program to read itself and print on the screen (Use Command Line Arguments).

import sys

with open(sys.argv[0], 'r') as f1:
    print(f1.read())
	
	
	
## 3. Predict output of the following piece of code:

f = open('file','w')
f.write('line with some characters')
f.close()


f = open('file','r')
print(f.tell())
print(f.read(4))
print(f.tell())


o/p:
0
Line
4

## 4. Write a program to read a file and copy it into a new file

with open('alphabets1.txt', 'r') as f1:
    with open('alphabets1copy.txt', 'w') as f2:
	    for line in f1:
		    f2.write(line)
	
## 5. Write a program to read a file and copy the contents to a new file such that the case gets
## reversed. i.e. upper case becomes lower case and vice versa


with open('sample1.txt', 'r') as f1:
    with open('alphabets1changecase.txt', 'w') as f2:
	    for line in f1:
		    f2.write(line.swapcase())
			
## 6. Write a program that take a file name as command line argument, opens it and then counts
## number of space characters in that file

import sys

with open(sys.argv[1],'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        count_space = line.count(' ')
    print("Number of spaces in file is :" , count_space)	
	
##7. Modify the above program to count the occurrence of each symbol i.e. count of alphabet ‘a’,
## count of spaces, count of commas and so forth

import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f2:
	d = {}
	for line in f2:
		for i in line:
			d[i] = d.get(i,0) + 1
	print(d)
	
## 8. Write a script called diff.py that take two file names as arguments and checks if the content of
## both the files is same and prints true or false.

import sys
with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f1:
    with open(sys.argv[2], 'r') as f2:
        if f2.read() == f1.read():
            print("True")
        else:
            print("False")



## 9. WAP to count the number of words in a file.


import sys

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as f:

    for line in f:
        w_l = line.split(' ')
    print (w_l)	
    print(len(w_l))
	
## 10. Update the above program to count the number of palindromes present in the file.


import sys

with open (sys.argv[1],'r') as f:
    pal=[]
    co_pal = 0
    for line in f:
        wor = line.lower().split()
    print(wor)
    for i in range(len(wor)):
        if wor[i] == wor[i][: : -1]:
            co_pal += 1
            pal.append(wor[i])
    print("Count of palindromes is :", co_pal)
    print("List of palindromes   :", pal)


##11. Update the program again to count and print number of anagrams in the file.
