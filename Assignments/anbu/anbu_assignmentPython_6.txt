1. WAP to input 2 numbers and check whether the first is divisible by the second and print true or
false depending on the divisibility.


    first = input()

2. In the palindrome example, make the code case insensitive.
i.e. Naman should also be treated as a palindrome (HINT: first convert to either upper or
lower case).

   third= input("enter the third side")

   if (one == second == third):
      print("All sides are equal ---> Equilateral triangle:")
   elif (one == second or second == third or one == third):

13. WAF: bmi() that takes the weight in kg and height in cm of a person, calculates and returns the
BMI.
Write code that calls this function after taking height and weight as inputs and then prints
underweight, normal, overweight or obese depending on the value of BMI.
Refer this link for the ranges:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index




def bmi(weight, height):
    height= height / 100
    bmi=weight//height * height
    print("bmi", bmi)

        print("under Weight")
    elif (bmi < 25 and bmi > 18.5):
        print("Normal Weight")
    elif(bmi > 25 and bmi < 30):
        print("Overweight")
    else:
        print("obese")
        
weight = input("Enter the weight in kg")
weight = int(weight)

height = input("Enter the height in cm")
height = int(height)

bmi(weight, height)

    print("first person is the eldest")
elif(second > first and second > third):
    print("second person is the eldest")
else:
    print("third person is the eldest")






15. WAP to input a number and check if number is divisible by both 5 and 7.

   print("Given number {0} is divisible by 5 and 7".format(i))
else:
   print("Given number {0} is not divisible by 5 and 7".format(i))
