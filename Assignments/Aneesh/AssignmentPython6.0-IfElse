Q:
WAP to input 2 numbers and check whether the first is divisible by the second and print true or
false depending on the divisibility.
A:
n1 = int(input("Enter the number 1:"))
n2 = int(input("Enter the number 2:"))
if n1%n2 == 0:
    print ("True : divisible")
else:
    print ("False : Not divisible")

Q:
In the palindrome example, make the code case insensitive.
i.e. Naman should also be treated as a palindrome (HINT: first convert to either upper or
lower case).
A:
s1 = input("Enter thw string:").upper()
s2 = s1[::-1]
if s1== s2:
    print ("It's palindrom")
else :
    print ("It's not a palindrom")
